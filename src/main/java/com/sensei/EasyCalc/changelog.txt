    EasyCalc: Make calculation Easier, better and faster
    
    EasyCalc is an advanced calculator with many futuristic abilities. EasyCalc 
has the ability to display complete expressions unlike many calculators, hence 
making calculation much easier. The main features of EasyCalc however, lie under 
the hood, where an advanced interpreter-parser weaves its magic, simplifying
expressions via the BODMAS rule. The many features of EasyCalc, combined, make it 
an extremely versatile calculator.
