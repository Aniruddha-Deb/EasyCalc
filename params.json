The result: Advanced calculator meets clear interface. The Interface, made using JavaFX, truly is a pleasure to use. \r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n## Advanced parsing and lexing\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:left; width:200px\">\r\n    ![img2](http://imgur.com/HIzkoNw)\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:left; width:200px\">\r\n    EasyCalc 2 carries over the reliable tried-and-tested logic of it's predecessor. The lexer breaks down the expression into a multitude of tokens which are then supplied to the parser, which generates and computes the parse tree on the fly. It may sound confusing, but EasyCalc does this every single time you press the 'equal to' key.\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n## Simple, efficient error management\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:left; width:200px\">\r\n    ![img3](http://imgur.com/GARD5On)\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:left; width:200px\">\r\n    Errors. We make them in every living hour. Be it typing your password wrong or putting salt instead of sugar in tea, they affect a large part of our life. Instead of belching out a stream of parse exceptions at the user's face, EasyCalc simply converts the text field into a shade of red, alerting the user to change the expression.    \r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"clear:both\"></div>\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n### Important links: \r\n    Source code: [https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb/EasyCalc](https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb/EasyCalc)\r\n    My GitHub Profile: [https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb](https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb)",
